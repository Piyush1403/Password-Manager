# Password-Manager

This is an insecure password manager written in Python. 

The account name and the password get stored as a key value pair in a .p file which another user can't read but can run.


## How to run - 

* Save the python file 
* Open terminal 
* Make the python file executable using ``` chmod +x filename.py ``` 
* Run the file using ```./filename.py``` presuming you're in the same directory.
